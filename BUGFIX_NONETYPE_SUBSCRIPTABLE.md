# Bug Fix: NoneType Object Not Subscriptable

## Issue
Error encountered: `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`

This error occurred in `api/main.py` when trying to access `data_dict.keys()` when `data_dict` was `None`.

## Root Cause

In `api/main.py` around line 220-303:

```python
# data_dict is initialized to None
data_dict = None

# ... later code may or may not set data_dict ...

# Then we try to access it without checking if it's None
logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Data Keys: {list(data_dict.keys())}")  # ❌ Fails if data_dict is None
if 'input' in data_dict:  # ❌ Fails if data_dict is None
    ...
```

The `data_dict` variable is initialized to `None` and only populated if `response.data` exists and has the expected structure. If the response doesn't have a `data` attribute or it's in an unexpected format, `data_dict` remains `None`, causing the error when we try to call `.keys()` on it.

## Fix Applied

Added a null check before accessing `data_dict`:

```python
# Log the full agent response for debugging
logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: ===== FULL AGENT RESPONSE =====")
logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Output: {output_data}")
logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Completed: {response_data['completed']}")
logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Intermediate Steps Count: {len(intermediate_steps)}")

# ✅ Check if data_dict exists before accessing it
if data_dict:
    logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Data Keys: {list(data_dict.keys())}")
    if 'input' in data_dict:
        logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Input: {data_dict['input'][:200]}...")
    if 'output' in data_dict:
        logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Data Output: {data_dict['output']}")
    if 'critiques' in data_dict:
        logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: Critiques: {data_dict['critiques']}")
else:
    logger.warning(f"Team {team_id}: data_dict is None - response.data may not be available")

logger.info(f"Team {team_id}: ===== END AGENT RESPONSE =====")
```

## Why This Happened

The error likely occurred because:

1. **Inspector Integration**: When we added the Inspector with the new API, the response structure may have changed
2. **Response Format**: The aixplain SDK may return responses in different formats depending on:
   - Whether inspectors are enabled
   - The execution path taken
   - Error conditions
3. **Defensive Programming**: The original code assumed `data_dict` would always be populated, but this isn't guaranteed

## Testing

After the fix:
- ✅ `test_agent_standalone.py` passes
- ✅ No more NoneType errors
- ✅ Proper warning logged when data_dict is None
- ✅ System continues to function even when response.data is unavailable

## Related Changes

This fix is part of the Inspector reintegration work where we:
1. Updated from deprecated `use_inspector=True` to `inspectors=[inspector]`
2. Added proper Inspector object creation with `InspectorAuto.CORRECTNESS`
3. Updated test mocks to support the new Inspector API

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always check for None before accessing object attributes or methods
2. Use `.get()` method for dictionary access when the key might not exist
3. Add defensive logging to help diagnose issues
4. Consider the response structure may vary based on configuration
