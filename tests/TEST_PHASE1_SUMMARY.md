## Test Coverage

### 1. Search Agent Model Default (4 tests) ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Search Agent defaults to production model (GPT-4o)
- ‚úÖ Search Agent can override model if explicitly specified
- ‚úÖ Production model is GPT-4o (6646261c6eb563165658bbb1)
- ‚úÖ Testing model is GPT-4o Mini (669a63646eb56306647e1091)

- ‚úÖ All entity types still defined
- ‚úÖ Output format still specified
- ‚úÖ MECE strategy still included
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible

### Expected Improvements
- ‚úÖ More powerful model reduces timeouts
- ‚úÖ Quiz page issue addressed
- ‚úÖ Specific query guidance provided

## Test-Driven Development Approach

These tests follow TDD principles:

1. **Red**: Tests would fail before changes (Search Agent used GPT-4o Mini)
2. **Green**: Tests pass after changes (Search Agent uses GPT-4o)
3. **Refactor**: Code is clean and maintainable

### Example TDD Cycle:

```python
# Test (Red - would fail before changes)
def test_search_agent_defaults_to_production_model(self):
    agent = TeamConfig.create_search_agent("Test Topic")
    assert agent.model == "production"  # Would fail with old code

# Implementation (Green - make it pass)
def create_search_agent(topic: str, model: str = "production"):
    # Changed from model: str = None
    ...

# Refactor (Clean up)
# Added documentation explaining why GPT-4o is forced
```

---

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Phase 1 Fixes
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Phase 1 tests
        run: python -m pytest tests/test_phase1_fixes.py -v
```

---

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests:

1. **If Search Agent model changes**: Update `test_search_agent_defaults_to_production_model`
2. **If instructions change**: Update relevant instruction tests
3. **If new features added**: Add new test classes
4. **If bugs found**: Add regression tests

### Test Naming Convention:

- `test_<what>_<expected_behavior>`
- Example: `test_search_agent_defaults_to_production_model`

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Tests Before Deployment
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_phase1_fixes.py -v
```

### 2. Monitor in Production
After deployment, monitor:
- Entity extraction counts (should be > 0)
- Timeout frequency (should decrease)
- Model usage logs (should show GPT-4o)

### 3. Add Integration Tests
When ready, run integration tests:
```bash
# Set API key
export AIXPLAIN_API_KEY=your_key

# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_phase1_fixes.py -m integration -v
```

### 4. Regression Testing
If issues occur, add regression tests:
```python
def test_regression_quiz_page_handling(self):
    """Regression test for quiz page issue from run e780f779"""
    # Test that agent handles quiz pages correctly
    ...
```
