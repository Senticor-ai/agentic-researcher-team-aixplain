# Team Execution Failure Diagnosis

## Problem
Teams are completing with status "completed" but returning 0 entities with error:
```
"An error occurred during execution. Please contact your administrator for assistance."
```

## Test Results

### ✅ Tavily Tool Test - PASSED
```bash
poetry run python test_tavily_tool.py
```
- Tool is accessible
- Tool executes successfully
- Returns search results correctly

### ✅ Standalone Agent Test - PASSED
```bash
poetry run python test_agent_standalone.py "Angela Merkel"
```
- Search Agent creates successfully
- Agent executes and returns entities
- Extracted: Person, Organization, Events, Policies
- Output saved to `test_agent_output_Angela_Merkel.json`

### ❌ Team Execution - FAILED
```bash
# Via API/UI
```
- Team creates successfully
- Team reports "completed" status
- Returns generic error message
- 0 entities extracted
- 0 intermediate steps

## Key Findings

1. **Tool Works**: Tavily tool is accessible and functional
2. **Agent Works**: Search Agent can execute standalone and extract entities
3. **Team Fails**: Only team execution fails with generic error

## Hypothesis

The issue is with **team coordination**, not individual components:

### Possible Causes:

1. **Team Agent Configuration Conflict**
   - Multiple agents with conflicting configurations
   - Model compatibility issues between team agents
   - Inspector or Mentalist blocking execution

2. **Interaction Limit**
   - Team might be hitting interaction limit before completing
   - But logs show "0 intermediate steps" which suggests it never started

3. **aixplain Platform Issue**
   - Team execution might have platform-level restrictions
   - Different execution path than standalone agents
   - Possible rate limiting or quota issues

4. **Prompt/Instructions Issue**
   - Team-level instructions might be malformed
   - Mentalist might not be able to plan properly
   - Response Generator might be failing

## Evidence from Server Logs

From team `20fe7f59-90b2-482e-b7d7-edd4e7ac909b`:

```
ERROR: Team agent configuration conflicts
ERROR: Tool (Tavily Search) not accessible or returned no results
ERROR: Agent execution failed or returned empty results
WARNING: No entities extracted from agent response
```

But standalone tests show:
- ✅ Tool IS accessible
- ✅ Agent CAN execute
- ✅ Entities CAN be extracted

This suggests the error messages are misleading - the real issue is team coordination.

## Comparison

| Component | Standalone | Team |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Tavily Tool | ✅ Works | ❓ Should work |
| Search Agent | ✅ Works | ❓ Should work |
| Entity Extraction | ✅ Works | ❌ Fails |
| Execution | ✅ Completes | ❌ Generic error |
| Intermediate Steps | ✅ 1 step | ❌ 0 steps |

## Next Steps

### 1. Simplify Team Configuration
Try removing optional agents:
- Remove Ontology Agent
- Remove Validation Agent
- Remove Wikipedia Agent
- Keep only Search Agent

### 2. Test with Minimal Team
Create a minimal team with:
- Just Mentalist + Search Agent
- No Inspector
- Simple prompt

### 3. Check aixplain Platform
- Verify team execution quotas
- Check if there are platform-level restrictions
- Contact aixplain support with:
  - Team ID: `68f1372b56dba95043001c7e`
  - Request ID: `68f1372b56dba95043001c7e_20251016181924`
  - Error: "An error occurred during execution"

### 4. Compare Configurations
- Standalone agent config vs team agent config
- Check if team-level settings conflict with agent settings

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Test with simplified team (remove optional agents)
2. **Short-term**: Add more detailed error logging from aixplain SDK
3. **Long-term**: Contact aixplain support for team execution issues
