# Task 9 Implementation Summary

## Overview

**Task**: 9. Improve entity extraction reliability for complex topics  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Date**: 2025-10-09

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 9, which aimed to improve entity extraction reliability for complex topics, particularly German government topics and niche administrative subjects.

---

## Subtasks Completed

### ✅ 9.1 Analyze entity extraction failures

**Objective**: Review test results and identify patterns in successful vs failed extractions.

**Deliverables**:
- Created comprehensive analysis document: `docs/ENTITY_EXTRACTION_ANALYSIS.md`
- Analyzed 48 Sachstand output files from previous test runs
- Identified 5 major failure modes
- Documented success patterns and common issues

**Key Findings**:
- **91.7% failure rate** (44/48 extractions failed)
- **German topics**: ~0% success rate
- **Very specific topics**: Consistently failed (topics with years, qualifiers)
- **Placeholder URLs**: Successful extractions had fake sources (example.com)
- **Tool access issues**: Suspected in most failures

**Failure Modes Identified**:
1. Tool Access Failures (High frequency)
2. Non-English Content Challenges (Very high for German topics)
3. Limited Source Availability (High for niche topics)
4. Parsing and Validation Issues (Medium)
5. Placeholder/Fabricated Data (Low but concerning)

### ✅ 9.2 Refine Search Agent prompts for better extraction

**Objective**: Add examples of successful extraction patterns and improve instructions for German/non-English topics.

**Deliverables**:
- Updated `api/agent_config.py` with improved prompts
- Updated `api/team_config.py` with enhanced Search Agent and Mentalist instructions
- Created documentation: `docs/PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- Created test script: `tests/test_improved_prompts.py`

**Key Improvements**:

1. **German Language Support**:
   ```
   LANGUAGE SUPPORT:
   - Search for information in BOTH English AND German
   - For German topics, prioritize German-language sources (.de domains)
   - Include entities from German sources with German descriptions
   ```

2. **Real Source URL Requirement**:
   ```
   CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Use REAL URLs from Tavily search results (never example.com)
   - Include actual excerpts from sources
   - Do NOT invent or fabricate entities
   ```

3. **Successful Extraction Examples**:
   - Added 3 concrete examples (German official, ministry, NGO)
   - Shows expected format and level of detail
   - Demonstrates German language entities

4. **Domain-Specific Guidance**:
   ```
   - For German government topics: ministers, state secretaries, agencies
   - For social topics: NGOs, welfare organizations, advocacy groups
   ```

5. **Enhanced Mentalist Instructions**:
   - Language-aware strategy
   - Quality requirements
   - Common failure modes to avoid

**Expected Impact**:
- Success Rate: 8.3% → >50% (target: 60-70%)
- German Topic Success: ~0% → >40% (target: 50%)
- Placeholder URL Rate: 100% → <10% (target: 0%)

### ✅ 9.3 Add fallback strategies for low-information topics

**Objective**: Implement multi-pass search strategy and alternative search terms.

**Deliverables**:
- Created new module: `api/search_strategy.py`
- Integrated into `api/agent_config.py` and `api/team_config.py`
- Updated `api/main.py` to provide helpful feedback
- Updated `api/models.py` to include feedback field
- Created documentation: `docs/FALLBACK_STRATEGIES.md`

**Key Features**:

1. **Topic Analysis**:
   - Detects language (de, en, mixed)
   - Determines specificity (broad, medium, specific, very_specific)
   - Identifies domain (government, social, technical, general)
   - Checks for year and location

2. **Alternative Search Terms Generation**:
   - Strategy 1: Remove year for very specific topics
   - Strategy 2: Broaden by removing modifiers (Lagebericht, Sachstand, etc.)
   - Strategy 3: Focus on core concept (main noun phrases)
   - Strategy 4: Add context for broad topics
   - Strategy 5: Domain-specific alternatives (Ministerium, NGO, etc.)

3. **Multi-Pass Search Instructions**:
   - Provides fallback search terms to agent
   - Instructs agent to try alternatives if <3 entities found
   - Combines results from multiple searches
   - Deduplicates by entity name

4. **Helpful Feedback Generation**:
   - Explains why extraction failed
   - Suggests alternative search terms
   - Provides actionable recommendations

**Example**:
```
Topic: "Jugendschutz Baden-Württemberg 2025"

Alternative Terms Generated:
1. "Jugendschutz Baden-Württemberg" (no year)
2. "Jugendschutz Baden-Württemberg Ministerium" (add ministry)
3. "Jugendschutz Baden-Württemberg Behörde" (add agency)

Agent Behavior:
1. Searches original → 0 entities
2. Tries alternative 1 → 2 entities
3. Tries alternative 2 → 1 more entity
4. Returns combined 3 entities
```

**Expected Impact**:
- Success Rate: >60% (target: 70%)
- German Topic Success: >50%
- Very Specific Topic Success: >40%

## Conclusion

Task 9 has been successfully completed with all three subtasks implemented:

1. ✅ **9.1**: Analyzed entity extraction failures and documented patterns
2. ✅ **9.2**: Refined Search Agent prompts with German support and examples
3. ✅ **9.3**: Implemented fallback strategies with multi-pass search

The implementation provides:
- **Comprehensive analysis** of failure modes
- **Improved prompts** with German language support and examples
- **Fallback strategies** with alternative search terms
- **Helpful feedback** for users when extraction fails
- **Test infrastructure** for validation

Expected improvements:
- Success rate: 8.3% → 60-70%
- German topic success: ~0% → 50%
- Data quality: Eliminate placeholder URLs

The system is now better equipped to handle:
- German government topics (critical for Baden-Württemberg ministry)
- Very specific topics (with years, qualifiers)
- Niche administrative topics
- Low-information topics

Next step is to run tests and validate the improvements with real agent executions.
