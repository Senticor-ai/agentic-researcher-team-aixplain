# Task 20 Implementation Summary: Entity Extraction Quality Improvements

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Task:** Improve entity extraction quality and reliability  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive improvements to entity extraction quality through analysis, prompt refinement, validation, and deduplication. These changes address the 21.8% success rate identified in the analysis and provide a foundation for achieving 60-70% success on German government topics.

## Sub-Tasks Completed

### 20.1 ✅ Analyze and Document Extraction Patterns

**Deliverable:** `docs/ENTITY_EXTRACTION_PATTERNS.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Analyzed 55 agent team executions
- Success rate: 21.8% (12 successful / 55 total)
- German government topics: 0% success rate (critical issue)
- German regional topics: 38% success rate (best performing)
- Quality issues: 22.5% placeholder URLs, 0% Wikipedia enrichment

**Patterns Identified:**
- ✅ **Success:** Specific named entities, concrete regional topics, active news coverage
- ❌ **Failure:** Broad policy reports, generic government topics, limited online presence

**Root Causes:**
1. German government information often in PDFs, not web pages
2. Tavily Search may not index German government documents effectively
3. Agent prompt not emphasizing German-language search strongly enough
4. No entity validation or quality checks
5. Wikipedia Agent not functioning (0% enrichment)

### 20.2 ✅ Refine Agent Prompts Based on Real-World Results

**File Modified:** `api/instructions/search_agent.py`

**Improvements Made:**

1. **Enhanced German-Language Support:**
   ```python
   - For German topics: PRIORITIZE German-language searches
   - Search German government websites (.de, .bund.de, .baden-wuerttemberg.de)
   - Use German search terms (e.g., "Ministerium", "Landesregierung")
   ```

2. **Specific Search Strategy:**
   ```python
   - For German government: "[topic] Baden-Württemberg site:.de"
   - For people: "[name] [role] Baden-Württemberg"
   - For organizations: "[organization name] [location]"
   - If < 3 entities found, try broader terms
   ```

3. **Stronger Quality Requirements:**
   - CRITICAL: Use REAL URLs (NEVER example.com, placeholder.com)
   - Detailed descriptions (minimum 10 words, 2-3 sentences)
   - Job titles REQUIRED for Person entities
   - Minimum 1 source with real URL and excerpt

4. **Better Examples:**
   - Added 4 concrete examples with real German government entities
   - Included Dr. Manfred Lucha (Minister), German ministries, NGOs
   - Showed proper URL structure and description format

5. **Quality Control Checklist:**
   ```
   ✓ Use REAL URLs from Tavily results
   ✓ Include actual excerpts from sources
   ✓ Provide detailed descriptions
   ✓ Include job titles for Person entities
   ✗ Do NOT use placeholder URLs
   ✗ Do NOT include entities without real sources
   ```

**Prompt Length:** 5,137 characters (increased from ~3,500 for better guidance)

### 20.3 ✅ Add Entity Validation and Quality Checks

**New File:** `api/entity_validator.py`

**Features Implemented:**

1. **URL Validation:**
   - Detects placeholder URLs (example.com, placeholder, test.com, localhost)
   - Validates URL structure (scheme, netloc)
   - Requires http/https protocol

2. **Authoritative Source Detection:**
   - Recognizes German government domains (.gov, .bund.de, .baden-wuerttemberg.de)
   - Identifies Wikipedia/Wikidata sources
   - Flags EU and federal government sources

3. **Quality Scoring (0.0 to 1.0):**
   - Valid name: +0.2
   - Description (≥10 chars): +0.2
   - Valid sources: +0.2
   - Authoritative sources: +0.2
   - Job title (Person) or URL (Organization): +0.1
   - Wikipedia link: +0.1

4. **Quality Thresholds:**
   - Minimum description length: 10 characters
   - Minimum name length: 2 characters
   - Minimum quality score: 0.3 (entities below are filtered)

5. **Validation Rules:**
   - Required fields: name, type, description, sources
   - Valid entity types: Person, Organization
   - At least one valid source URL
   - No placeholder URLs allowed

6. **Quality Indicators for UI:**
   - Quality badge: high (≥0.7), medium (0.4-0.7), low (<0.4)
   - Authoritative source indicator
   - Wikipedia enrichment indicator

**Integration:** Modified `api/entity_processor.py` to use EntityValidator

**Validation Metrics Tracked:**
```python
{
  "total_entities": 10,
  "valid_entities": 7,
  "rejected_entities": 3,
  "rejection_reasons": {
    "Invalid or placeholder URL": 2,
    "Description too short": 1
  },
  "quality_scores": {
    "high": 2,
    "medium": 4,
    "low": 1
  },
  "avg_quality_score": 0.65
}
```

### 20.4 ✅ Implement Entity Deduplication

**File Modified:** `api/entity_processor.py`

**Deduplication Strategy:**

1. **Authoritative Deduplication (Priority 1):**
   - Use Wikidata IDs for authoritative matching
   - Entities with same Wikidata ID are merged
   - Tracks Wikidata-based deduplication count

2. **Name-Based Deduplication (Priority 2):**
   - Case-insensitive name matching
   - Groups by entity type + normalized name
   - Handles variations (e.g., "Dr. Manfred Lucha" vs "dr. manfred lucha")

3. **Merge Strategy:**
   - Use entity with highest quality score as base
   - Combine all sources from duplicates
   - Keep longest/most detailed description
   - Preserve all Wikipedia links and Wikidata IDs
   - Prefer entities with job titles (Person) or URLs (Organization)
   - Recalculate quality score after merge

**Deduplication Stats Tracked:**
```python
{
  "original_count": 5,
  "final_count": 2,
  "duplicates_found": 3,
  "entities_merged": 5,
  "wikidata_dedup": 1,
  "name_dedup": 1
}
```

**Example:**
```
Input:
  - Dr. Manfred Lucha (score: 0.70, 1 source)
  - Dr. Manfred Lucha (score: 0.80, 1 source, Wikidata: Q1889089)
  - dr. manfred lucha (score: 0.60, 1 source, Wikidata: Q1889089)

Output:
  - Dr. Manfred Lucha (score: 0.80, 3 sources, Wikidata: Q1889089)
    ↳ Merged 3 entities, kept best description, combined all sources
```

## Integration Changes

   - Changed return signature: `(sachstand, mece_graph, validation_metrics)`

2. **`api/main.py`:**
   - Updated to handle new return signature from `process_agent_response()`
   - Added logging for validation metrics
   - Added logging for deduplication stats
   - Logs show: entities passed, quality score, duplicates removed, Wikidata usage

3. **`api/instructions/search_agent.py`:**
   - Completely rewritten prompt with German-language focus
   - Added search strategy section
   - Enhanced examples with real German entities
   - Added quality control checklist

## Testing Results

### Entity Validator Tests
```
✅ Valid entity with authoritative source: Score 0.70
❌ Entity with placeholder URL: Rejected (score 0.20)
✅ Entity with missing job title: Accepted (score 0.60, recommended field)
```

### Deduplication Tests
```
Input: 5 entities (3 duplicates of "Dr. Manfred Lucha", 2 of "Caritas")
Output: 2 entities (merged by Wikidata ID and name)
Stats: 3 duplicates removed, 1 Wikidata dedup, 1 name dedup
```

## Expected Impact

### Before Implementation
- Success rate: 21.8%
- German government topics: 0% success
- Placeholder URLs: 22.5% of entities
- Wikipedia enrichment: 0%
- No quality validation
- No deduplication

### After Implementation
- **Expected success rate: 60-70%** on German government topics
- **Expected success rate: 80%+** on concrete regional topics
- **Zero placeholder URLs** (validation rejects them)
- **Quality-scored entities** with badges for UI
- **Automatic deduplication** using Wikidata IDs
- **Detailed validation metrics** for monitoring

### Specific Improvements

1. **German Government Topics:**
   - Stronger German-language search emphasis
   - Site-specific search strategy (.de domains)
   - Better examples of German government entities
   - Should improve from 0% to 60-70% success

2. **Entity Quality:**
   - All entities have quality scores
   - Placeholder URLs eliminated
   - Minimum description length enforced
   - Authoritative sources prioritized

3. **Deduplication:**
   - Wikidata-based authoritative deduplication
   - Name-based fallback for entities without Wikidata
   - Combined sources from duplicates
   - Cleaner, more accurate entity lists

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Validation metrics in execution logs
   - Deduplication stats tracked
   - Quality score distribution visible
   - Rejection reasons documented

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing Needed
1. Test with previously failed German government topics:
   - "Sozialer Lagebericht Baden-Württemberg"
   - "Landesaktionsplan zur Umsetzung der Istanbul-Konvention"
   - "Ausländische Abschlüsse und Qualifikationen"

2. Test with specific German entities:
   - "Dr. Manfred Lucha"
   - "Ministerium für Soziales Baden-Württemberg"
   - "Caritas Baden-Württemberg"

3. Verify validation metrics appear in UI

### Future Enhancements (Not in Task 20)
1. **Fix Wikipedia Agent** (currently 0% enrichment)
2. **Add Firecrawl** for government document parsing
3. **Implement MECE decomposition** for broad topics
4. **Add Google Search fallback** when Tavily yields <3 entities
5. **Create topic validation** to warn users about overly broad topics
