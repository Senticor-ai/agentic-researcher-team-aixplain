# Entity Extraction Patterns Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Analysis Period:** 55 completed agent team executions  
**Success Rate:** 21.8% (12 successful / 55 total)

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 55 agent team executions reveals significant challenges in entity extraction reliability. Only 21.8% of topics successfully extracted entities, with 43 topics (78.2%) returning empty results. The system performs better on concrete, specific topics (e.g., "Wolfgang Ihloff", "Wertstoffsammlungen in Baden-Württemberg") but struggles with broad policy topics and German government-specific queries.

## Key Findings

### 1. Success Patterns

**Topics That Work Well:**
- **Specific named entities**: "Wolfgang Ihloff" (3 entities), "Brauereien In Baden-Württemberg" (2 entities)
- **Concrete regional topics**: "Wertstoffsammlungen in Baden-Württemberg" (6 entities - highest success)
- **Specific policy areas**: "Wasserstoffnetz Rechtsgrundlage" (3 entities), "Sachlage Zurückweisungen an der Grenze" (4 entities)
- **Youth-related topics**: "Jugendarmut Baden-Württemberg 2025" (4 entities), "Jugendarmut NGOs Baden-Württemberg 2025" (3 entities)

**Common Success Characteristics:**
- Specific geographic scope (Baden-Württemberg)
- Concrete subject matter (waste collection, breweries, specific people)
- Clear entity types expected (organizations, people)
- Topics with active news coverage or public information

### 2. Failure Patterns

**Topics That Consistently Fail (0 entities):**
- **Broad policy reports**: "Sozialer Lagebericht Baden-Württemberg", "Landesaktionsplan zur Umsetzung der Istanbul-Konvention"
- **Generic government topics**: "Ausländische Abschlüsse und Qualifikationen", "Welche Regelungen gelten bei der Einbürgerung in BW"
- **Youth protection topics**: "Jugendschutz Baden-Württemberg 2025"
- **Test topics**: Many test executions with generic topics

**Common Failure Characteristics:**
- Very broad or abstract topics
- Topics requiring deep government document analysis
- Topics with limited online presence outside official documents
- Topics that may require PDF parsing or document extraction
- German-language topics with limited English sources

### 3. Entity Type Distribution

**Total Entities Extracted:** 40 entities across 12 successful topics

**Entity Type Breakdown:**
- **Organizations**: 27 entities (67.5%)
- **Persons**: 13 entities (32.5%)

**Observation:** System extracts significantly more organizations than people, suggesting:
- Tavily Search returns more organizational information
- Agent prompt may favor organizational entities
- German government topics naturally involve more institutions than individuals

### 4. Quality Metrics

**Entity Quality Analysis (40 total entities):**

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| With descriptions | 40 | 100% |
| With job titles (Person entities) | 3 | 23% of persons |
| With Wikipedia links | 0 | 0% |
| With real URLs | 31 | 77.5% |
| With placeholder URLs (example.com) | 9 | 22.5% |

**Quality Issues Identified:**
1. **No Wikipedia enrichment**: 0% of entities have Wikipedia links despite Wikipedia Agent being configured
2. **Placeholder URLs**: 22.5% of entities use example.com or placeholder URLs (quality issue)
3. **Missing job titles**: Only 23% of Person entities have job titles
4. **Wikipedia Agent not functioning**: No sameAs properties found in any entity

### 5. Topic Category Performance

| Category | Count | Avg Entities | Success Rate |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| German Government | 2 | 0 | 0% |
| German Regional | 8 | 2.5 | ~38% |
| German Social | 2 | 2.0 | ~50% |
| English General | 14 | 0.5 | ~14% |
| Test Topics | 29 | 0.3 | ~10% |

**Key Observations:**
- **German Government topics fail completely** (0% success) - major issue for ministry use case
- **German Regional topics perform best** (38% success) - concrete local topics work
- **English General topics struggle** (14% success) - may indicate Tavily Search limitations
- **Test topics have low success** (10%) - expected due to generic nature

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why German Government Topics Fail

1. **Information Accessibility**:
   - Government information often in PDF reports, not web pages
   - Tavily Search may not index German government documents effectively
   - Official ministry websites have limited structured data

2. **Topic Complexity**:
   - Topics like "Landesaktionsplan zur Umsetzung der Istanbul-Konvention" are very specific
   - Require deep document analysis, not just web search
   - May need Firecrawl or document parsing tools

3. **Language Barriers**:
   - German-specific topics may have limited English sources
   - Tavily Search may prioritize English results
   - Agent prompt may not emphasize German-language search strongly enough

### Why Some Topics Succeed

1. **Active News Coverage**:
   - Topics like "Jugendarmut" have recent news articles
   - NGOs and organizations actively publish about these topics
   - More web-accessible information

2. **Concrete Entities**:
   - "Wolfgang Ihloff" is a specific person with online presence
   - "Wertstoffsammlungen" involves specific organizations and programs
   - Clear entities to extract

3. **Regional Specificity**:
   - Baden-Württemberg topics have local news coverage
   - Regional organizations and officials are documented online

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix Wikipedia Agent Integration**:
   - Currently 0% Wikipedia enrichment despite agent being configured
   - Investigate why Wikipedia Agent output is not being merged
   - Add logging to track Wikipedia Agent execution

2. **Eliminate Placeholder URLs**:
   - 22.5% of entities use example.com URLs (quality issue)
   - Strengthen agent prompt to ONLY use real URLs from Tavily results
   - Add validation to reject entities with placeholder URLs

3. **Improve German-Language Search**:
   - Emphasize German-language search in agent prompt
   - Add explicit instruction to prioritize .de domains
   - Test with German-specific search queries

4. **Add Entity Validation**:
   - Reject entities without real source URLs
   - Require minimum description length
   - Add quality scoring based on source authority

### Medium-Term Improvements

5. **Add Firecrawl for Government Documents**:
   - German government topics need document crawling
   - Firecrawl can extract content from official websites
   - Implement Crawl Agent for deep content extraction

6. **Enhance Agent Prompts with Examples**:
   - Add more German government entity examples
   - Include examples of successful extractions from analysis
   - Provide guidance for handling PDF-heavy topics

7. **Implement Entity Deduplication**:
   - Merge entities with same name and type
   - Use Wikipedia/Wikidata IDs for authoritative deduplication
   - Combine sources from duplicate entities

8. **Add Fallback Strategies**:
   - If Tavily returns < 3 entities, try Google Search
   - If no entities found, suggest broader search terms
   - Provide helpful feedback to users

### Long-Term Enhancements

9. **Add Document Parsing**:
   - Integrate Docling for PDF extraction
   - Parse government reports and policy documents
   - Extract entities from structured documents

10. **Implement MECE Decomposition**:
    - Break down broad topics into specific sub-topics
    - Research each sub-topic separately
    - Aggregate entities across sub-topics

11. **Add Quality Scoring**:
    - Score entities based on source authority (.gov, official sites)
    - Prioritize entities with multiple sources
    - Filter low-quality entities before output

12. **Create Topic Validation**:
    - Warn users about overly broad topics
    - Suggest more specific search terms
    - Provide examples of successful topics

## Testing Recommendations

### Topics to Test After Improvements

**German Government (Currently 0% success):**
- "Dr. Manfred Lucha" (specific minister)
- "Ministerium für Soziales Baden-Württemberg" (specific ministry)
- "Integrationsgesetz Baden-Württemberg" (specific legislation)

**German Regional (Currently 38% success):**
- "Caritas Baden-Württemberg" (specific NGO)
- "Flüchtlingshilfe Stuttgart" (specific city + topic)
- "Jugendamt Karlsruhe" (specific agency)

**Broad Topics (Currently failing):**
- "Integration policies Baden-Württemberg" (test MECE decomposition)
- "Kinderarmut Deutschland" (test fallback strategies)
- "Sozialer Wohnungsbau BW" (test document parsing)

## Conclusion

The current 21.8% success rate is insufficient for production use. The system works well for concrete, specific topics with active web presence but fails on broad government policy topics - the primary use case for the ministry.

**Critical Issues:**
1. Wikipedia Agent not functioning (0% enrichment)
2. Placeholder URLs in 22.5% of entities
3. German government topics have 0% success rate
4. No entity deduplication or quality validation

**Priority Actions:**
1. Fix Wikipedia Agent integration
2. Strengthen URL validation and German-language search
3. Add entity validation and quality checks
4. Implement deduplication logic

With these improvements, we expect to achieve 60-70% success rate on German government topics and 80%+ on concrete regional topics.
