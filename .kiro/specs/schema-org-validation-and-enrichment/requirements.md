# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that all ontologies returned from the agent team system are valid schema.org entities with working URLs and references. The agent team will be enhanced with specialized agents responsible for schema.org validation, URL verification, and Wikipedia enrichment. These agents will work as part of the team workflow to ensure data quality at the source, rather than relying on post-processing. This improves data quality, interoperability, and trustworthiness of the OSINT research outputs through proactive agent-driven validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Schema.org Validation Agent

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want all returned entities to be valid schema.org entities, so that I can reliably integrate the data with other systems and tools that expect schema.org format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent team is created THEN the system SHALL include a Schema.org Validator Agent in the team configuration
2. WHEN the Schema.org Validator Agent receives entity data THEN it SHALL validate that each entity type is a valid schema.org type
3. WHEN the Schema.org Validator Agent processes entities THEN it SHALL validate that all entity properties conform to schema.org property definitions for that type
4. WHEN the Schema.org Validator Agent finds an entity with @context field THEN it SHALL verify it points to "https://schema.org"
5. WHEN the Schema.org Validator Agent finds an entity with @type field THEN it SHALL verify it matches a valid schema.org type (Person, Organization, Event, CreativeWork, etc.)
6. IF the Schema.org Validator Agent finds non-conforming properties THEN it SHALL provide feedback to the Response Generator to correct the issues
7. WHEN the Schema.org Validator Agent completes validation THEN it SHALL provide a validation report to the Inspector agent

### Requirement 2: URL Verification Agent

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want all URLs and references in entity data to be valid and accessible, so that I can verify sources and follow up on information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent team is created THEN the system SHALL include a URL Verification Agent in the team configuration
2. WHEN the URL Verification Agent receives entity data THEN it SHALL validate that all URL fields are properly formatted
3. WHEN the URL Verification Agent processes URLs THEN it SHALL verify that each URL is accessible (returns HTTP 200 or similar success status)
4. WHEN the URL Verification Agent finds source URLs THEN it SHALL validate each source URL for format and accessibility
5. IF the URL Verification Agent finds an invalid or inaccessible URL THEN it SHALL provide feedback to the Search Agent or Response Generator to find alternative sources
6. WHEN the URL Verification Agent finds a "sameAs" property THEN it SHALL validate that all URLs in the array are valid and accessible
7. IF the URL Verification Agent determines more than 30% of an entity's URLs are invalid THEN it SHALL flag the entity to the Inspector for quality review
8. WHEN the URL Verification Agent completes validation THEN it SHALL provide URL validation metrics to the Inspector agent

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Wikipedia Agent Integration

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want entities to be linked to Wikipedia and Wikidata where available, so that I can access authoritative reference data and multilingual information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent team is created THEN the system SHALL ensure the Wikipedia Agent is configured with schema.org linking capabilities
2. WHEN the Wikipedia Agent enriches an entity THEN it SHALL add the "sameAs" property with Wikipedia and Wikidata URLs in schema.org format
3. WHEN the Wikipedia Agent enriches an entity THEN it SHALL add the "wikidata_id" property with the Wikidata identifier
4. WHEN the Wikipedia Agent enriches an entity THEN it SHALL add the "wikipedia_links" property with multilingual Wikipedia URLs
5. WHEN the Wikipedia Agent adds links THEN it SHALL validate that all Wikipedia URLs are properly formatted and accessible
6. WHEN the Wikipedia Agent finds an invalid or inaccessible Wikipedia URL THEN it SHALL attempt to find alternative Wikipedia sources
7. IF the Wikipedia Agent cannot find valid Wikipedia data THEN it SHALL log this information but still allow the entity to proceed
8. WHEN the Wikipedia Agent completes enrichment THEN it SHALL report enrichment statistics to the Inspector agent

### Requirement 4: Inspector Agent Enhanced Reporting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed validation reports and metrics, so that I can monitor data quality and identify issues that need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Inspector Agent receives validation data from validator agents THEN it SHALL generate a comprehensive validation report with overall statistics
2. WHEN the Inspector Agent generates a report THEN it SHALL include: total entities, valid entities, invalid entities, and validation pass rate
3. WHEN the Inspector Agent generates a report THEN it SHALL include schema.org compliance metrics from the Schema.org Validator Agent
4. WHEN the Inspector Agent generates a report THEN it SHALL include URL validation metrics from the URL Verification Agent
5. WHEN the Inspector Agent generates a report THEN it SHALL include Wikipedia enrichment metrics from the Wikipedia Agent
6. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the Inspector Agent SHALL log detailed error messages with entity names and specific validation failures
7. WHEN the Inspector Agent completes its review THEN it SHALL include the validation report in the team execution output for storage

### Requirement 5: Response Generator Schema.org Compliance

**User Story:** As a data quality engineer, I want the Response Generator to produce schema.org compliant output with proper formatting, so that output quality is maximized from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Response Generator creates entity output THEN it SHALL ensure all entities have a valid @context field pointing to "https://schema.org"
2. WHEN the Response Generator creates entity output THEN it SHALL ensure all entity types use proper schema.org type names with correct casing
3. WHEN the Response Generator creates entity output THEN it SHALL ensure all property names conform to schema.org property definitions
4. WHEN the Response Generator receives feedback from the Schema.org Validator Agent THEN it SHALL correct any non-conforming properties
5. WHEN the Response Generator receives feedback from the URL Verification Agent THEN it SHALL attempt to correct malformed URLs or find alternative sources
6. WHEN the Response Generator merges Wikipedia enrichment data THEN it SHALL ensure all Wikipedia links are properly formatted in schema.org structure
7. WHEN the Response Generator completes output generation THEN it SHALL include correction statistics in its output for the Inspector to review

### Requirement 6: Orchestrator Agent Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the validation agents to be properly integrated into the team workflow, so that validation happens at the right stages of the research process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Orchestrator Agent coordinates the research workflow THEN it SHALL spawn the Wikipedia Agent after the Search Agent completes entity extraction
2. WHEN the Orchestrator Agent coordinates the research workflow THEN it SHALL spawn the URL Verification Agent after entities have been enriched with Wikipedia data
3. WHEN the Orchestrator Agent coordinates the research workflow THEN it SHALL spawn the Schema.org Validator Agent before the Response Generator creates final output
4. WHEN validation agents provide feedback THEN the Orchestrator SHALL route that feedback to the appropriate agents (Search Agent, Wikipedia Agent, or Response Generator)
5. IF validation agents identify critical issues THEN the Orchestrator SHALL coordinate a correction cycle before allowing the workflow to proceed
6. WHEN all validation agents complete their work THEN the Orchestrator SHALL signal the Response Generator to create the final validated output
7. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the Orchestrator SHALL ensure all validation metrics are included in the execution log
