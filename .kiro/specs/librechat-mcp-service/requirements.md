# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service that enables LibreChat to interact with the OSINT agent team system. The MCP service will expose tools that allow LibreChat users to spawn agent teams for specific topics and retrieve historical data from past agent team executions. All responses will be provided in JSON-LD format to ensure semantic interoperability and structured data representation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Agent Team Spawning

**User Story:** As a LibreChat user, I want to spawn an agent team for a specific topic through MCP tools, so that I can leverage the OSINT agent system directly from my chat interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user invokes the spawn agent team tool with a topic THEN the system SHALL create a new agent team execution for that topic
2. WHEN the agent team is spawned THEN the system SHALL return a unique execution ID to track the run
3. WHEN the agent team completes its analysis THEN the system SHALL return the results in JSON-LD format
4. IF the topic parameter is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
5. WHEN spawning an agent team THEN the system SHALL support optional parameters for team configuration (e.g., agent types, search depth)

### Requirement 2: Historical Data Retrieval

**User Story:** As a LibreChat user, I want to retrieve data from past agent team runs, so that I can review previous analyses without re-running the entire process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user invokes the retrieve past runs tool THEN the system SHALL return a list of available execution IDs with metadata
2. WHEN a user requests a specific execution by ID THEN the system SHALL return the complete JSON-LD response for that run
3. WHEN querying past runs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by topic, date range, and execution status
4. IF an execution ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
5. WHEN retrieving historical data THEN the system SHALL include execution metadata (timestamp, topic, status, duration)

### Requirement 3: JSON-LD Response Format

**User Story:** As a LibreChat user, I want all agent team responses in JSON-LD format, so that I can integrate the data with semantic web tools and ensure structured, machine-readable output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent team completes execution THEN the system SHALL format the response as valid JSON-LD
2. WHEN generating JSON-LD THEN the system SHALL include appropriate @context, @type, and semantic properties
3. WHEN returning entities THEN the system SHALL represent them with proper linked data semantics
4. WHEN returning relationships THEN the system SHALL use JSON-LD graph structures to represent connections
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL return error information in a JSON-LD compatible format

### Requirement 4: MCP Server Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP service to follow the Model Context Protocol specification, so that it can be easily integrated with LibreChat and other MCP-compatible clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL expose tools following the MCP specification
2. WHEN LibreChat connects to the MCP server THEN it SHALL successfully discover available tools
3. WHEN a tool is invoked THEN the system SHALL handle requests and responses according to MCP protocol
4. WHEN the server encounters an error THEN it SHALL return properly formatted MCP error responses
5. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL support concurrent requests from multiple LibreChat sessions

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Storage

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want agent team execution data to be persisted, so that historical runs can be retrieved even after server restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent team execution completes THEN the system SHALL persist the JSON-LD response to storage
2. WHEN storing execution data THEN the system SHALL include all metadata (topic, timestamp, status, configuration)
3. WHEN the MCP server restarts THEN it SHALL be able to retrieve all previously stored executions
4. WHEN storage capacity is reached THEN the system SHALL implement a retention policy or provide warnings
5. WHEN querying stored data THEN the system SHALL provide efficient retrieval without loading all data into memory
